<strong>Oregon Trail In a GUI!</strong>

This is my version of the classic DOS-era game Oregon Trail, albeit with a satirical twist! After all, the trek west in the mid-1800s surely wasn't as glamorous as modern movies and literature make it out to be. Project runs starting with oregontrailmainloop.py. From there <strong>oregontrailgame()</strong> is assigned to an object <strong>otg</strong> and is passed to <strong>OregonTrail().mainloop()</strong>, which will take care of booting up the GUI and beginning the game! Enjoy! Critiquing is much appreciated!
